# I don't know what I'm doing

## Overview:
This is a [Ring](https://ring.com) home monitor for ppl who are somehow broke enough to afford ring protect. I'm neither a professional developer nor have I ever written anything in [TypeScript](https://github.com/topics/typescript) (until now). I doubt I'll update this much, so feel free to use this repo more as a starting point/template from which you can fork from.

## Installation:
- #### curl:
  propably the easiest and fastest installation
  ``` bash
    cd /your/desired/directory/
    curl https://github.com/Maiku19/advrngmntr/releases/latest/download/advrngmntr.sh -o installer.sh
    ./installer.sh
  ```
- #### git clone:
  ``` bash

  ```
